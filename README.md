- 👋 Hi, Miruna here, a final semester Computer Science student at the University of Vienna
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, C++, human-computer interaction, computer vision and the  
      impact of technology on the society
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my Python and C++ skills, learn machine learning and better software design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that falls within my interest and particularly  
      on open-source projects with a cause
- 📫 You can reach to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miruna-diana-jarda-25abb81b9/)
